FetchFox takes the raw text of a website, and uses AI to extract data the user is looking for. You describe the data you're looking for in plain English.

You can use FetchFox to quickly gather data like building a list of leads, assembling research data, or scoping out a market segment.

By scraping raw text with AI, FetchFox lets you circumvent anti-scraping measures on sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Even the the complicated HTML structures are possible to parse with FetchFox.
